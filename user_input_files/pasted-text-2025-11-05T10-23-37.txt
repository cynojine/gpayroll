The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis:
- The TypeScript compiler error shows "Property 'status' does not exist on type 'Employee'" ([line 79](#L79), context around [lines 156–160](#L156-L160)). This is a TypeScript type error: your code accesses employee.status in a filter, but the Employee type/interface definition does not include a status property.

Solution:
1. Locate the Employee type/interface definition in your repo (search for "interface Employee" or "type Employee"). Verify that the file is committed to the repo.
2. Add the status property to that type with the correct type (make it optional if not always present). Example — update whatever file defines the Employee type (for example src/types.ts or src/models/Employee.ts):

```ts
// e.g. src/types.ts
export interface Employee {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  department?: string;
  // add status (adjust union/type to match your data)
  status?: 'active' | 'inactive' | string;
  // other fields...
}
```

3. If you prefer to keep type changes minimal or need a quick guard in the filter, change the filter logic to check for the property before accessing it:

```ts
const matchesStatus =
  !statusFilter ||
  ('status' in employee && employee.status === statusFilter);
```

or cast when necessary (temporary):

```ts
const matchesStatus = !statusFilter || (employee as any).status === statusFilter;
```

4. If the Employee objects come from an external source (e.g. Supabase), make sure the typed result includes status (update your fetch typings or the generated types).

5. Rebuild locally to verify the fix:
- Run the TypeScript/React build: npm run build
- Or run a type check: npx tsc --noEmit

6. Commit the change and push. Netlify will pick up the updated type and the build should succeed.

If you need me to point to the exact file to change in this repo, tell me where your Employee type is declared (or share the path), and I’ll provide the exact code diff.
